Brain Break
...Or Yet Another RSI Prevention Tool. This time prettier and happier.

Brain Break is designed to satisfy those who are not suffering from RSI,
but are concerned about the mental and physical issues associated with
heavy computer use. As a result, it is not particular about whether you
are using a keyboard or a mouse or simply looking at the screen; the
goal here is to encourage you to space computer use around other things.

Brain Break should stay out of the way and be as non-destructive as
possible, accommodating users regardless of their current tasks without
requiring that they change its aggressiveness themselves. It should avoid
threatening people with things such as permanent statistics, but provide
incentives to be healthy which fit the moment at hand.

GNOME Break Timer keeps track of your computer use and provides a gentle
reminder to take regular breaks. This is great for anyone concerned about the
mental or physical issues associated with heavy computer use. GNOME Break
Timer aims to be effective over a long time, so it is assertive as possible
without being irritating. It avoids threatening people with negative things
like permanent usage statistics, but it provides incentives to be healthy
which fit the moment at hand.
